📊 Data Analytics Project
🔍 Overview
This project represents a full data analytics lifecycle — starting from data import and cleaning in Python, performing in-depth exploratory data analysis, executing SQL queries for deeper insight extraction, and finally building an interactive Power BI dashboard supported by a structured report and presentation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn


SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server


Visualization: Power BI


Presentation: Gamma


Workspace: Jupyter Notebook



🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding
Imported the raw dataset into Python


Explored structure, datatypes, and initial anomalies


2️⃣ Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates and handled missing values


Corrected inconsistent formats & data types


Treated outliers for improved accuracy


3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics and distribution analysis


Trend and pattern visualization using charts


Correlation assessment for actionable variables


4️⃣ SQL Integration & Analysis
Loaded the cleaned dataset into SQL database


Executed queries including joins, aggregations, filters, and window functions
